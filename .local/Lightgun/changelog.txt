The new Linux driver is significantly changed, here are the main features:

2 lightguns run in a single instance, including calibration.
Joystick mode is now supported (but not required on the Pi).
Hold Dpad Up for 5 seconds to toggle recoil On/Automatic/Off.
Calibration screen won't instantly exit if you are pointing in the bottom right when it loads.
Lots more resilience functionality.
It's a good base for further improvements.
